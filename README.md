# django-conditions

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RevolutionTech/django-conditions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RevolutionTech/django-conditions)

Move conditional logic that changes often from code into models so that the logic can be easily modified in admin.

django-conditions is under active development. You can follow my progress [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/XQnzHWYZ).

Usage and other details coming soon.
